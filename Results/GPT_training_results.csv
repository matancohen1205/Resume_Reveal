Started with a stored procedure template to create specific stored procedures based off of group requirements. Then used SSIS expressions to build bank Positive Pay output files that would have header, trailer and/or detail rows. Expressions were used to build this format to match sample files that were originally built in Access, which needed to be converted to SQL. Each group had its own unique file format and then later schedules for these output files were created via SQL agent to send file to clients on a schedule. All packs fed off an existing stored procedure that loaded a table with data to prep it for the generation of the output file.
Developed SSIS packages that used variables to store values for various purposes such as directory paths, file naming formats and conventions, and also dynamic updating date stamps for file names.

About Me:  
I’m a product-minded full stack developer with 4 years of experience in fast-paced teams. I thrive when I can take responsibility for a feature across the stack — shaping the API contracts, building a responsive UI, and handling the edge cases.

Hey there, I'm Peter Lewis, a freelance full stack developer based in Be’er Sheva, Israel. For the last 4 years, I've been building apps for startups, NGOs, and agencies who want quick iterations and high-quality results. I thrive in async setups and remote teams, and I always aim for clear handoff and maintainable code.

My recent gigs include:

- Building a custom booking calendar in React for a dental clinic (integrated with Twilio + Google Calendar API)  
- Rebuilding a legacy Rails app's frontend in Vue 3, while keeping backend integration clean  
- Developing a small TypeScript CMS for a news site with rich media upload and custom workflows  
- Helping a fintech MVP team set up CI pipelines with GitHub Actions and Docker for their Node.js/React stack

At Enlivio (2021–Present), I joined as the second engineer and helped scale the platform from hundreds to tens of thousands of users. I built the onboarding flows, the internal admin panel, and refactored legacy endpoints into RESTful services with predictable errors.

More than shipping code, I’ve written test strategies, design docs, and even API onboarding guides for new hires. I’m the person who fixes flaky tests on Friday so no one has to deal with them Monday morning.

Location: Tel Aviv, Israel

Summary:  
I’m a curious and hands-on full-stack developer who thrives in learning environments and creative problem solving. My background is rooted in self-study and project-based exploration: after leaving a customer support role at a fintech startup, I committed to transitioning into tech through an intense 10-month coding bootcamp followed by freelance and open-source contributions.

I take pride in the fact that I built my first three applications entirely solo — from database design and API development to frontend styling and deployment. Each project taught me how to break large problems into testable features and how to remain consistent in code quality and naming conventions.

I bring strong communication skills from my prior customer-facing experience. I'm calm under pressure, self-motivated, and thrive when given a clear mission and the space to experiment. I genuinely enjoy getting stuck on something — because it means learning is happening.

"Name: Michal Barak  
Email: michal.barak.engineer@gmail.com  
Location: Haifa, Israel

Summary:  
I approach software engineering from a place of structure and curiosity. My degree in mathematics gave me deep experience in analytical thinking, and I’ve found that mindset essential when designing reliable systems and debugging unfamiliar behavior.

I began learning programming by helping my sibling debug a Python homework project. One function led to another, and within a year I was building my own small applications and contributing to open-source issues. I joined a student research group in 2022 and helped optimize Python scripts used in a biology lab — that was my first real exposure to “code that matters.”

What drives me today is clean architecture and collaboration. I love breaking down requirements with a team and proposing implementation plans. I write clear documentation, I ask thoughtful questions, and I’m not afraid to admit when I don’t know something — because that’s the first step to learning it.

I bring a unique combination of creativity, communication, and logic.

After finishing an intensive bootcamp in 2023, I worked on a mix of freelance and personal projects that emphasized UX details — forms with validation, fluid animations, contrast-aware color systems. I thrive on taking messy specs and translating them into structured, semantic, maintainable code.

One of my strengths is user empathy. I naturally ask: Who will use this? Will they get stuck? Can they reach it on mobile? I try to bake accessibility into every component from the beginning, and I test regularly using Lighthouse and screen readers.

Introduction:  
Code is my medium, but experience is my goal. I come from a background in visual arts, and that instinct for composition and user flow stayed with me when I transitioned to frontend development. What excites me is building interactions that feel effortless and intuitive — and debugging the moments when they don’t.

I think like a user, but write like an engineer. I pay attention to the invisible stuff: keyboard accessibility, contrast ratios, consistent animation timing. I’ve been the one raising issues during design reviews, writing custom aria-labels, or adjusting focus traps — because good UI doesn’t just look right, it behaves right.

Recent Work:  
- Helped rebuild a multi-tab interface using React + custom hooks, reduced re-renders and improved perceived load time  
- Converted a legacy SASS codebase to Tailwind, cleaning dozens of redundant classes and enabling design tokens

Personal Summary:  
I’ve always been fascinated by the tension between intuition and numbers. In my work as a data analyst, I try to bridge that — turning gut feelings into hypotheses, and data into stories that help others decide better.

I don’t just query datasets. I argue with them. Why is this cohort spiking here? What happened before that feature launched? Why does the bounce rate climb after 6pm? I treat every anomaly as a conversation.

My career so far has focused on marketing and product analytics. I’ve built dashboards, refactored models, created attribution logic from scratch, and coached non-data colleagues on how to self-serve answers responsibly.

Core Projects:  
- Defined customer segmentation logic and implemented event-based tracking across funnel milestones  
- Automated weekly product KPIs with SQL + Looker, reducing report prep from 3 hours to 10 minutes  
- Conducted deep-dive analyses of churn behaviors, resulting in a 2-point retention improvement

Over time, I realized my favorite part of the job wasn’t catching bugs — it was understanding how systems work and imagining how I’d build them differently.

That interest has evolved into action. Over the past year, I’ve been deepening my development skills: building full-stack side projects, rewriting internal test tools into modular Node services, and participating in open-source tasks. My goal is now clear: move fully into software development and contribute as a builder, not just a tester.

Relevant Experience:  
- Built CLI tools in Node.js for validating config files used by test environments  
- Migrated automated test suite from Protractor to Cypress (involved code refactoring)  
- Created a lightweight internal dashboard with React + Firebase for test result reporting  
- Took backend learning track (Express + MongoDB) and delivered a working group project

"Name: Shani Ben-Harush  
Email: shani.bh.devops@gmail.com  
Location: Netanya, Israel

Background:  
For the past five years, I’ve worked as a Tier 3 technical support engineer for a SaaS platform, handling escalated issues, reading logs, and resolving infrastructure-level problems. Over time, I found myself writing small automation scripts, digging into CI jobs, and collaborating with DevOps on customer-facing reliability.

That exposure evolved into a path — I began learning Terraform, built CI pipelines from scratch in my sandbox, and shadowed deployment routines. I’m now actively shifting into a DevOps role and looking to join a team where I can go deeper into infrastructure, observability, and automation.

Highlights:  
- Automated recurring support tasks using Python scripts (CSV parsing, cron-based reporting)  
- Set up Docker-based test environments for client reproduction  
- Rebuilt CI pipeline for internal QA team using GitHub Actions and matrix testing  
- Practiced provisioning workflows using Terraform with AWS test projects

Intro:  
I started out in a QA/UI validation role — testing layouts, browser behavior, and client-side interactions across responsive breakpoints. While I became deeply familiar with frontend workflows from the outside, I found myself more and more interested in the building side of things.

Over the last year, I’ve been working on my own apps and diving into modern React. I’ve rebuilt real test flows I used to check manually, but now from the developer’s seat. I’m now looking for a position as a frontend developer where I can continue that momentum and grow in a structured, mentored environment.

What I’ve Done:  
- Built UI test demo app for simulating form validation and real-time feedback  
- Refactored internal QA dashboards into reusable React components  
- Practiced styling with both utility-first (Tailwind) and semantic CSS  
- Participated in frontend guild at my current company as a learner and contributor

Location: Tel Aviv, Israel

Background:  
For the past four and a half years, I’ve worked as a full-stack developer — building APIs, frontend dashboards, and integrations for B2B SaaS platforms. While I enjoyed coding, I found myself increasingly focused on understanding the “why” behind every feature request: how it supports the user journey, where it fits in the strategy, and how to balance impact vs. effort.

I started collaborating more closely with PMs, participating in customer feedback sessions, writing technical scoping docs, and even helping structure roadmap tickets. That exposure led to a realization: I want to move into product. I’m now actively pursuing PM roles where I can bring my technical fluency to strategic thinking, prioritization, and user impact.

Key Experience:  
- Led the full development of a usage analytics feature, working closely with product to define KPIs and instrumentation  
- Proposed UX changes to reduce onboarding friction based on developer feedback analysis  
- Wrote internal RFCs and scoped backlog epics including effort estimates and implementation paths  
- Helped support account managers with technical enablement and sandbox walkthroughs

Location: Herzliya, Israel

About Me:  
I come from DevOps — three years of automating infrastructure, writing CI pipelines, and monitoring systems. But over time I found myself drawn to questions like: which services are noisy? which teams are stuck on manual ops? where are the bottlenecks that hurt users?

So I started building reports. First for myself. Then for the team. Then I was asked to present to engineering leadership. It became clear: I was doing analysis, not just automation. That’s when I shifted tracks. I’ve since completed courses in SQL and BI, rebuilt our team dashboard using Metabase, and contributed to cost-saving efforts through data.

Now I’m looking for a formal role as a data analyst or analytics engineer where I can continue working at the intersection of systems and impact.

What I’ve Done:  
- Built service-level SLO dashboards to prioritize alerting improvements  
- Wrote internal reports on pipeline flakiness and deployment success over time  
- Rebuilt monitoring dashboards to support team OKRs in reliability and velocity  
- Queried infrastructure logs to identify idle resources and cut costs

Summary:  
Originally trained and working as a data analyst, I spent the last three years querying behavioral data, supporting marketing experiments, and building dashboards in SQL and Python. Over time, I began automating parts of my work — feature extraction, pattern detection — and got pulled into modeling discussions.

I’ve since completed projects using scikit-learn and HuggingFace models, and I’m eager to transition fully into machine learning engineering. My analyst background keeps me grounded in business value, but my direction now is building production-ready models, not just analyzing patterns.

Experience:  
- Built lead scoring classifier for sales ops using logistic regression and tree-based models  
- Created text classifier for open-ended survey feedback (HuggingFace pipeline, ~84% accuracy)  
- Deployed model as Flask API with versioned scoring for internal stakeholders  
- Took advanced courses in model monitoring and deployment

Background:  
Started in QA automation — built test frameworks, wrote E2E flows, and pushed quality culture. But I kept getting pulled into failure analysis, monitoring dashboards, and CI/CD performance. That's how I found my new direction: reliability engineering.

Now I’m transitioning into SRE — with a focus on incident response, observability, and scalable deployment. My QA background gives me a good eye for edge cases and regression, and I’ve added experience in alerts tuning, infra code, and postmortems.

Relevant Experience:  
- Migrated legacy smoke tests to run as synthetic probes in production  
- Tuned Prometheus alerts to reduce false positives across 3 environments  
- Created Grafana dashboards tied to service-level objectives  
- Ran internal root cause analysis writeups and published postmortem docs

I’m now shifting into a more code-oriented automation development role — building reusable test frameworks and CI setups for hardware validation. I enjoy when low-level signals and Python logic meet.

What I’ve Done:  
- Built serial-based CLI automation for embedded board testing using PySerial  
- Wrote regression test runner to validate board boot & config profiles (pytest + YAML)  
- Interfaced with lab equipment (oscilloscopes, power meters) using SCPI and VISA
